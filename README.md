# HDIGRL
As illustrated in Fig. 1, HDIGRL is a heterogeneous dual-channel and interpretable graph representation learning framework for predicting potential miRNA-drug sensitivity associations under sparse and imbalanced supervision. HDIGRL first constructs a heterogeneous miRNA-drug network by integrating observed miRNA-drug sensitivity links with miRNA-miRNA similarity and drug-drug similarity relations, providing the structural backbone for representation learning. Based on this network, HDIGRL extracts dual-channel node features from complementary perspectives: Adamic-Adar captures topology-aware local proximity, while Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity captures interaction-pattern-derived functional relatedness. Since the two channels reside in different semantic spaces, they are projected into a unified latent space and adaptively fused via a self-attention aggregation module to form initial node embeddings. Subsequently, to alleviate propagation interruption caused by extreme sparsity, a small set of globally connected virtual nodes is introduced to collect and broadcast graph-level context, thereby facilitating long-range information exchange. 
On the augmented graph, stacked graph attention layers are employed to refine node representations, and a lightweight channel gate is inserted after each layer to recalibrate embedding channels and suppress redundant or noisy dimensions during deep propagation. Finally, miRNA and drug embeddings are decoded by a bilinear decoder to produce association scores, and the entire framework is optimized using Focal Loss to emphasize hard and rare positive pairs under severe class imbalance. For interpretability, HDIGRL further supports post-hoc edge-level explanations for individual predictions to facilitate mechanism-oriented analysis.
